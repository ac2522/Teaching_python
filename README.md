# Teaching_python
8 lessons worth of material from the basics to data scraping, machine learning and automation.
Some of the practice questions were taken from elsewhere. 
The first three lectures are based on "python for finance" udemy course (but this has been rewritten and expanded on). 
The rest, including projects, is entirely my own. For better or worse...


1) Python_for_finance_1.ipynb
2) Python_for_finance-2.ipynb
3) Python_for_Finance_3.ipynb
4) Questions.ipynb     +     questions with answers.ipynb
5) Python_for_finance_4.ipynb
6) Python_for_finance_5.ipynb
7) Python_for_finance_6.ipynb
8) Python_for_finance_7.ipynb
9) Python_for_finance_end_project.ipynb

Good luck!
