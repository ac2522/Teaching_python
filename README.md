# Teaching_python
9 lessons worth of material from the basics to data scraping, machine learning and automation
Some of the practice questions were taken from elsewhere. 
The first three lectures are based on "python for finance" udemy course (but this has been rewritten and expanded on). 
The rest, including projects, is entirely my own




1) Python_for_finance_lesson_1.ipynb
2) Python_for_finance-2.ipynb
3) Python_for_Finance_3 (1).ipynb
4) Questions.ipynb     +     questions with answers.ipynb
5) Python_for_finance_4.ipynb
6) Python_for _finance_5.ipynb
7) Python_for_finance_6
8) Python_for_finance_7.ipynb
9) Python_for _finance_end_project.ipynb

Good luck!
